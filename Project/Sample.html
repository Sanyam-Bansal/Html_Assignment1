        <img class="img" src="Image1.jpg">
        <p style="color: blue;">Holi is another noteworthy name in the list of festivals of India. Considered the festival of love and the festival of colors, it signifies the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. It is celebrated all over the country with a lot of enthusiasm and fervor. Typically, the celebrations start on the eve of the festival. Huge bonfires are lit (symbolizing the burning of the mythical demoness Holika), and people sing and dance around this crackling fire. On the day of the Holi festival, they put dry and wet colors of various hues on each other. Playing with water guns and balloons filled with colored water, and drinking bang thandai (a desi cocktail made with Indian spices) are some of the key attractions of Holi.</p>
